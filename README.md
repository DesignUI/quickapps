## How it works?
The app uses LG Quick Circle SDK and QSlide SDK.  
* Torch - Enable/Disable camera flash.  
* Music - Register `NotificationListenerService` that implements `RemoteController.OnClientUpdateListener`.  
* Notifications - Register another `NotificationListenerService`.  
* Calendar - Reading events data from `CalendarContract.Events`.  
* Toggles - Each toggles use its permissions to change the state.  
* Stopwatch - Uses `TimerTask` that run every 10 milliseconds to update the clock.
* Calculator - Evaluate the math string using EvalEx library.
* News - Use Feedly Cloud Api to receive the newest 20 articles from the user feed.
